#### My-Projects-in-R

- My name is **Xiang Wang**, a Master student in Applied Statistics at *The Pennsylvania State University*. I will graduate in **May 2016**. 
- I have multidisciplinary trainings in statistics and life science (PhD in Horticulture from *Iowa State University*). 
- The courses I have taken (**GPA: 3.84**) are: Probability Theory, Mathematical Statistics, Applied Statistics, Regression Methods, SAS and R Programming, Applied Data Mining and Statistical Learning, Design of Experiments, Applied Multivariate Statistical Analysis, Clinical Trials, Statistical Consulting Practicum.
- The following projects are exclusively conducted in **R** for my graduate courses.


##### Case 01: classification and prediction models to maximize mail return rates
Developed eight classification models to maximize the net profit and make mailings more cost-effective; Built seven regression models to predict donation amounts and minimize the mean squared prediction errors

##### Case 02: Classification of human activity manners from exercise data 
Built a classification model with more than 95% accuracy to identify in which manner participants did the exercise; Conducted principal components analysis to choose appropriate predictors

##### Case 03: Selection of regression models from diabetes data
Developed four regression models to predict the response using ten predictor variables

##### Case 04: Classification of gene expression data  
Identified interacted genes using five classification methods from protein-protein interaction data 

##### Case 05: Consulting practice sensory evaluation of French fries 
Practiced the whole process of statistical consulting – communicating, data analysis, writing; Satisfied the client’s research and statistical questions in how oil types and ages affect fries’ quality; Wrote an R function that reads all Excel sheets and puts them in a list

##### Case 06: Visualizing and EDA from PM2.5 emissions data

##### Case 07: Visualizing and EDA from household data

##### Case 08: Making a multi-panel barplot using *Rhododendron* data 

##### Case 09: Impact of severe weather

##### Case 10: Exploring the wearable data
