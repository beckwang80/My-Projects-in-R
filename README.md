#### My-Projects-in-R

- My name is **Xiang Wang**, a Master student in Applied Statistics at *The Pennsylvania State University*. I will graduate in **May 2016**. 
- I have multidisciplinary trainings in statistics and life science (PhD in Horticulture from *Iowa State University*). 
- The courses I have taken (**GPA: 3.84**) are: Probability Theory, Mathematical Statistics, Applied Statistics, Regression Methods, SAS and R Programming, Applied Data Mining and Statistical Learning, Design of Experiments, Applied Multivariate Statistical Analysis, Clinical Trials, Statistical Consulting Practicum.
- The following projects are exclusively conducted in **R**. They ranged from exploring and visualizing data to apply various algorithms or models in data mining and machine learning to solve challenging real-world issues such as regression, classification and clustering methods.


##### Case 01: classification and prediction models to maximize mail return rates

* Developed classification models to maximize the net profit and make mailings more cost-effective including logistic regression, linear and quadratic discriminant analysis, K nearest-neighbors, regression tree, random forest and support vector machine 

* Built seven regression models to predict donation amounts and minimize the mean squared prediction errors including least square, stepwise, best subset, ridge, lasso and principal components regression 

##### Case 02: Classification of human activity manners from exercise data 

* Identified an optimal classification model (RF) with more than 95% accuracy to predict which manner participants did the exercise including multinomial logit regression, linear and quadratic discriminant analysis, and random forest (RF)

* Conducted principal components analysis to choose appropriate predictors

##### Case 03: Selection of regression models from diabetes data

* Developed regression models to predict the response using ten predictor variables including least square, stepwise, best subset, ridge and lasso regression

##### Case 04: Classification of gene expression data  

* Identified interacted genes using classification methods from protein-protein interaction data including logistic regression, linear and quadratic discriminant analysis, K nearest-neighbors and generalized additive model 

##### Case 05: Consulting practice sensory evaluation of French fries 

* Practiced the whole process of consulting â€“ communicating, data analysis and reporting 

* Wrote an R function that reads all Excel sheets and puts them in a list

##### Case 06: Visualizing and EDA from PM2.5 emissions data

##### Case 07: Visualizing and EDA from household data

##### Case 08: Making a multi-panel barplot using *Rhododendron* data 

##### Case 09: Impact of severe weather

##### Case 10: Exploring the wearable data
